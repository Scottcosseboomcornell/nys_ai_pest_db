Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling and before eating, drinking, chewing gum, using tobacco or using the toilet. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse. This product is toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates. Do not contaminate water when disposing of equipment washwater or rinsate. Treated seed exposed on soil surface may be hazardous to wildlife. Cover or collect seeds spilled during loading. Groundwater Advisory: Azoxystrobin and a degradate of azoxystrobin are known to leach through soil into groundwater under certain conditions as a result of label use. These chemicals may leach into groundwater if used in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow. Mefenoxam is known to leach through soil into groundwater under certain conditions as a result of label use. This chemical may leach into groundwater if used in areas where soils are permeable, particularly where the water table is shallow. Fludioxonil has properties and characteristics associated with chemicals detected in groundwater.
