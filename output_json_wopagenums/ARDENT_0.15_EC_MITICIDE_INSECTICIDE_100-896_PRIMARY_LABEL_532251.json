            "general_Info": "May be fatal if swallowed. Causes substantial but temporary eye injury. Do not get in eyes or on clothing. Harmful if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Avoid contact with skin. Prolonged or frequently repeated exposure may cause allergic skin reactions in some individuals. Avoid breathing spray mist. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling and before eating, drinking, chewing gum or using tobacco. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse.",
            "if_In_Eyes": "Hold eye open and rinse slowly and gently with water for 15-20 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after the first 5 minutes, then continue rinsing eye. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Swallowed": "Call poison control center or doctor immediately for treatment advice. Do not give any liquid to the person. Do not induce vomiting unless told to do so by the poison control center or doctor. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.",
            "if_On_Skin": "Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 minutes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Inhaled": "Move person to fresh air. If person is not breathing, call 911 or an ambulance, then give artificial respiration, preferably by mouth-to-mouth, if possible. Call a poison control center or doctor for further treatment advice.",
            "physician_Note": "Early signs of intoxication include dilation of pupils, muscular incoordination, and muscular tremors. Toxicity following accidental ingestion of this product can be minimized by early administration of chemical adsorbents (e.g., activated charcoal). If toxicity from exposure has progressed to cause severe vomiting, the extent of resultant fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be gauged. Appropriate supportive parenteral fluid replacement therapy should be given, along with other required supportive measures (such as maintenance of blood pressure levels and proper respiratory functionality) as indicated by clinical signs, symptoms, and measurements. In severe cases, observations should continue for at least several days until clinical condition is stable and normal. Since abamectin is believed to enhance GABA activity in animals, it is probably wise to avoid drugs that enhance GABA activity (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, valproic acid) in patients with potentially toxic abamectin exposure."
