            "physician_Note": "NOTE TO PHYSICIAN Early signs of intoxication include dilation of pupils, muscular incoordination, and muscular tremors. Toxicity following accidental ingestion of this product can be minimized by early administration of chemical absorbents (e.g., activated charcoal). If toxicity from exposure has progressed to cause severe vomiting, the extent of resultant fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be gauged. Appropriate supportive parenteral fluid replacement therapy should be given, along with other required supportive measures (such as maintenance of blood pressure levels and proper respiratory functionality) as indicated by clinical signs, symptoms, and measurements. In severe cases, observations should continue for at least several days until clinical condition is stable and normal. Since abamectin is believed to enhance GABA activity in animals, it is probably wise to avoid drugs that enhance GABA activity (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, valproic acid) in patients with potentially toxic abamectin exposure.",
            "if_On_Skin": "Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 minutes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
