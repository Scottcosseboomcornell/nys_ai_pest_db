Engineering Control Statement: When handlers use closed systems, enclosed cabs, or aircraft in a manner that meets the requirements listed in the Worker Protection Standard (WPS) for agricultural pesticides [40 CFR 170.240(d)(4-6)], the handler PPE requirements may be reduced or modified as specified in the WPS. Important: When reduced PPE is worn because a closed system is being used, handlers must be provided all PPE specified above for \u201cApplicators and Other Handlers\u201d and have such PPE immediately available for use in an emergency, such as a spill or equipment breakdown.",
