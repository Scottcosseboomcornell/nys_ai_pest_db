            "physician_Note": "Possible mucosal damage may contraindicate the use of gastric lavage; chemical adsorbents are recommended to reduce adsorption of the product. Persons suffering with temporary allergic skin reactions may respond to treatment with oral antihistamines and topical or oral steroids. If in eyes, the upper and lower lids should be retracted and irrigated, and any particulate matter should be carefully removed from the conjunctival fornix. Irrigation should be continued until the conjunctival sac is neutral on pH testing with universal indicator paper. Fluorescein staining is required to reveal the extent of corneal or conjunctival epithelial loss. Topical antibiotic ointments are indicated when corneal epithelial damage is identified. Use of steroid eye drops is not advocated unless expressly requested by an ophthalmologist. Have the product container or label with you when calling a poison control center or doctor, or going for treatment.
