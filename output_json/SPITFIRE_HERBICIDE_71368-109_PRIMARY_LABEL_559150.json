If you want more options, follow the instructions for category F or G on an EPA chemical-resistance category selection chart. All mixers, loaders, applicators, flaggers, and other handlers must wear: long-sleeved shirt and long pants, protective eyewear, shoes and socks, chemical-resistant gloves, and chemical-resistant apron when mixing or loading, cleaning up spills or equipment, or otherwise exposed to the concentrate. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for cleaning/maintaining PPE. If no such instructions for washables exist, use detergent and hot water. Keep and wash PPE separately from other laundry. See engineering controls for additional requirements. Engineering Control Statements: When handlers use closed systems, enclosed cabs or aircraft in a manner that meets the requirements listed in the Worker Protection Standard (WPS) for agricultural pesticides [40 CFR 170.240(d)(4-6)], the handler PPE requirements may be reduced or modified as specified in the WPS. Pilots must use an enclosed cockpit that meets the requirements listed in the Worker Protection Standard (WPS) for agricultural pesticides [40 CFR 170.240(d) 4].",
