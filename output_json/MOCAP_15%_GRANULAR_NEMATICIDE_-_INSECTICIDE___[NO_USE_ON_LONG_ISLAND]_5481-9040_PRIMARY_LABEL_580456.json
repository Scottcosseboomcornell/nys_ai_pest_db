Severe symptoms and signs include diarrhea, pinpoint and non-reactive pupils, respiratory difficulty, pulmonary edema, cyanosis, loss of sphincter control, convulsions, and coma. Support respiration as needed. Measures should include removal of secretions, maintenance of a patent airway, and if necessary, artificial ventilation. If cyanosis is absent, give ATROPINE 2-4 mg intravenously (0.05 mg/kg for children). Repeat atropine at 5-10 minute intervals until atropinization occurs (dry, flushed skin, tachycardia, pupillary dilatation), and maintain for 48 hours. If cyanotic, give initial atropine intramuscularly and start measures to improve ventilation. Start 2-PAM (PROTOPAM, Ayerst) at the same time. Give 1-2 grams PROTOPAM (20-40 mg for children) in 100 cc saline over 15-30 minutes. If pulmonary edema is present, give intravenously slowly as a 5% solution in water over a period of at least 5 minutes. A second dose may be given after one hour if muscle weakness persists. Additional doses may be given cautiously for persistent muscle weakness. May be given by intramuscular or subcutaneous routes if intravenous administration is not feasible. In case of skin contact, wash patient with soap and water followed by wash with 95% ethyl alcohol. Keep patient under constant observation for 24-36 hours. Symptoms may persist for one month. The use of theophylline, morphine, barbiturates, phenothiazines, reserpine, and succinyl choline is contraindicated.",
