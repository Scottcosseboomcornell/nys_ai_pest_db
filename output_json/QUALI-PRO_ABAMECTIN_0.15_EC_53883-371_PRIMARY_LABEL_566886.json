            "general_Info": "May be fatal if swallowed. Causes substantial but temporary eye injury. Do not get in eyes. Harmful if absorbed through skin or inhaled. Avoid contact with skin or clothing. Avoid breathing spray mist. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling and before eating, drinking, chewing gum, or using tobacco. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse.",
            "if_In_Eyes": "Hold eye open and rinse slowly and gently with water for 15-20 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after the first 5 minutes; then continue rinsing eye. Call a poison control center or doctor immediately for treatment advice.",
            "if_Swallowed": "Call a poison control center or doctor immediately for treatment advice. Do not give any liquid to the person. Do not induce vomiting unless told to do so by the poison control center or doctor. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.",
            "if_On_Skin": "Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of soap and water for 15-20 minutes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Inhaled": "Move person to fresh air. If person is not breathing, call 911 or an ambulance; then give artificial respiration, preferably mouth-to-mouth, if possible. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "physician_Note": "Early signs of intoxication include mydriasis (dilated pupils), ataxia (unsteadiness), and muscle tremors. Toxicity follows accidental ingestion of Quali-Pro Abamectin 0.15 EC and can be minimized by promptly administering activated charcoal. If toxicity from exposure has progressed to cause severe vomiting, the extent of resultant fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be gauged. Appropriate supportive parenteral fluid replacement therapy should be given along with other required supportive measures (such as maintenance of blood pressure levels and respiratory functionality) as indicated by clinical signs, symptoms, and measurements. In severe cases, observations should continue for at least several days until clinical condition is stable and normal. Since abamectin is believed to enhance GABA activity in animals, it is probably wise to avoid drugs that enhance GABA activity (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, valproic acid) in patients with potentially toxic abamectin exposure. Have the product container or label with you when calling a poison control center or doctor or going for treatment. You may also contact SafetyCall\u00ae (866) 897-8050. for emergency medical treatment information.",
