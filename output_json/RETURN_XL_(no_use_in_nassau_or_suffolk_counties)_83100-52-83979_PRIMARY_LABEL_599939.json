Administer repeated doses, 1.2 to 2.0 mg intravenously every 10 to 30 minutes until full atropinization is achieved. Maintain atropinization until the patient recovers. Artificial respiration or oxygen may be necessary. Allow no further exposure to any cholinesterase inhibitor until recovery is assured. Do not use 2-PAM for exposure to RETURN\u2122 XL alone. However, for exposure to combinations of RETURN\u2122 XL and organophosphorous insecticides, 2-PAM may be used as required to supplement the atropine sulfate treatment. Do not use morphine.",
