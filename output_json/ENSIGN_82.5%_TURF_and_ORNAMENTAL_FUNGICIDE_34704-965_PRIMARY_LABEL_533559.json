Persons suffering with temporary allergic skin reactions may respond to treatment with oral antihistamines and topical or oral steroids. If in eyes, the upper and lower lids should be retracted and irrigated, and any particulate matter should be carefully removed from the conjunctival fornix. Irrigation should be continued until the conjunctival sac is neutral on pH testing with universal indicator paper. Fluroscein staining is required to reveal the extent of corneal or conjunctival epithelial loss. Topical antibiotic ointments are indicated when corneal epithelial damage is identified. Use of steroid eye drops is not advocated unless expressly requested by an Ophthalmologist.",
