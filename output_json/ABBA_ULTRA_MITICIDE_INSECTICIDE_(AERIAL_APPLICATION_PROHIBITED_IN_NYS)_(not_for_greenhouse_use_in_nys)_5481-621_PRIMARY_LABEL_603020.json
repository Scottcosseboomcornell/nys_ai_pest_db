            "if_Swallowed": "Call a poison control center or doctor immediately for treatment advice. Have person sip a glass of water. Do not induce vomiting unless told to do so by a poison control center or doctor. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.",
            "if_On_Skin": "Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of soap and water for 15 \u2013 20 minutes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Inhaled": "Move person to fresh air. If person is not breathing, call 911 or an ambulance, then give artificial respiration, preferably mouth-to-mouth, if possible. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "physician_Note": "Early signs of intoxication include mydriasis (dilated pupils), ataxia (unsteadiness), and muscle tremors. Toxicity following accidental ingestion of the AbbA ULTRA can be minimized by promptly administering activated charcoal. If toxicity from exposure has progressed to cause severe vomiting, the extent of resultant fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be gauged. Appropriate supportive parenteral fluid replacement therapy should be given, along with other required supportive measures (such as maintenance of blood pressure levels and respiratory functionality) as indicated by clinical signs, symptoms, and measurements. In severe cases, observations should continue for at least several days until clinical condition is stable and normal. Since abamectin is believed to enhance GABA activity in animals, it is probably wise to avoid drugs that enhance GABA activity (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, valproic acid) in patients with potentially toxic abamectin exposure. Have the product container or label with you when calling a poison control center or doctor, or going for treatment.",
