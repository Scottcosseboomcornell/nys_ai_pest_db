            "if_In_Eyes": "Hold eye open and rinse slowly and gently with water for 15-20 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after the first 5 minutes, then continue rinsing. Rinse eye only with water. Do not put eye drops, drugs, or ointments in eyes unless specifically recommended by a medical doctor or poison control center.

            "if_Inhaled": "Move person to fresh air. If person is not breathing, call 911 or an ambulance, then give artificial respiration, preferably mouth-to-mouth, if possible. Call a poison control center or doctor for further treatment advice.",
            "if_On_Skin": "Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 minutes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "physician_Note": "Possible mucosal damage may contraindicate the use of gastric lavage; chemical adsorbents are recommended to reduce adsorption of the product. Persons suffering from temporary allergic skin reactions may respond to treatment with oral antihistamines and topical or oral steroids. If in eyes, the upper and lower lids should be retracted and irrigated, and any particulate matter carefully removed from the conjunctival fornix. Continue irrigation until the conjunctival sac is neutral on pH testing with universal indicator paper. Fluorescein staining is required to reveal the extent of corneal or conjunctival epithelial loss. Topical antibiotic ointments are indicated when corneal epithelial damage is identified. Use of steroid eye drops is not advocated unless expressly requested by an ophthalmologist. Have the product container or label with you when calling a poison control center or doctor, or going for treatment. For 24-hour medical or chemical emergency assistance, call 1-800-888-8372."
