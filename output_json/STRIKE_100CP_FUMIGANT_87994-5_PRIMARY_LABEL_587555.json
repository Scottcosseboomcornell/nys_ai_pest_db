Where chemical-resistant materials are required, leather, canvas, or cotton materials offer no protection from this product and must not be worn as the sole article of protection when contact with this product is possible. When performing tasks with NO potential for contact with liquid fumigant, all handlers (including applicators) must wear: \u2022 Long-sleeved shirt and long pants, and \u2022 Shoes and socks. When performing tasks with potential for contact with liquid fumigant, all handlers (including applicators) must wear: \u2022 Long-sleeved shirt and long pants, \u2022 Chemical-resistant gloves, \u2022 Chemical-resistant apron, \u2022 Protective eyewear (Do NOT wear goggles), and \u2022 Chemical-resistant footwear with socks. In addition, when an air-purifying respirator is required under this label\u2019s Directions for Use, Protection for Handlers, Respiratory Protection and Stop Work Triggers sections, handlers must wear at minimum either: \u2022 A NIOSH certified full facepiece air-purifying respirator equipped with an organic vapor (OV, NIOSH approval prefix TC-23C) cartridge and a particulate pre-filter (Type N, R, P, or HE, NIOSH approval number prefix TC-84A), or \u2022 A gas mask with a canister approved for organic vapor (NIOSH approval number prefix TC-14G).",
