            "physician_Note": "NOTE TO PHYSICIAN: Rinse eye(s) with running water for at least 20 minutes. If only one eye is affected, avoid washing substance into the unexposed eye. Treat symptomatically. In case of ingestion of concentrate, probable mucosal damage may contraindicate the use of gastric lavage. Repeat doses of activated charcoal are contraindicated if the patient has absent bowel sounds because of the risk of obstruction. Maintain respiration, monitor ECG and blood gases. Correct acidosis with i.v. sodium bicarbonate. Control convulsions with diazepam and treat hypotension with volume replacement and inotropes (e.g., dopamine or dobutamine) as necessary. Monitor CPK for rhabdomyolysis. Forced alkaline diuresis in the treatment of severe phenoxy acid poisoning is no longer recommended due to the risk of electrolyte imbalance. Urinary alkalinization is less hazardous. The recommended regimen for urinary alkalinization is as follows: To maintain urine pH greater than 7.5, adults should be given 50 ml boluses of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate i.v. and/or 1 liter of 1.26% sodium bicarbonate plus 40 mmol potassium i.v. over 4 hours. Children should be given 1 ml/kg of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate plus 20 mmol potassium diluted in 500 ml dextrose saline infused at 2 to 3 ml/kg/ hour. These guidelines are subject to review and a Poison Control Center should be contacted in each case where treatment is likely to be necessary.",
