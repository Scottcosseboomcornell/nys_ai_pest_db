Treatment consists of binding diquat in the gut with suspensions of activated charcoal or bentonite clay, administration of cathartics to enhance elimination, and removal of diquat from the blood by charcoal hemoperfusion or continuous hemodialysis. If in eyes, treat symptomatically. Symptoms may develop gradually. Severe damage may be caused by apparently trivial contact and healing may be delayed. Medical supervision should be continued until healing is complete.",
