            "general_Info": "WARNING: May be fatal if swallowed. Causes substantial but temporary eye injury. Do not get in eyes or on clothing. Harmful if absorbed through skin or inhaled. Avoid contact with skin. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling and before eating, drinking, chewing gum, using tobacco or using the toilet. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse. Prolonged or frequently repeated exposure may cause allergic reactions in some individuals.",
            "if_In_Eyes": "Hold eye open and rinse slowly and gently with water for 15-20 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after the first 5 minutes; then continue rinsing. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Swallowed": "Call a poison control center or doctor immediately for treatment advice. Have person sip a glass of water if able to swallow. Do not induce vomiting unless told to by a poison control center or doctor. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.",
            "if_On_Skin": "Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 minutes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Inhaled": "Move the person to fresh air. If person is not breathing, call 911 or an ambulance; then give artificial respiration, preferably mouth-to-mouth if possible. Call a poison control center or doctor for further treatment advice.",
            "physician_Note": "Early signs of intoxication include mydriasis (dilated pupils), ataxia (unsteadiness), and muscle tremors. Toxicity follows accidental ingestion of Quali-Pro Abamectin 0.15 EC and can be minimized by promptly administering activated charcoal. If toxicity from exposure has progressed to cause severe vomiting, the extent of resultant fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be gauged. Appropriate supportive parental fluid replacement therapy should be given, along with other required supportive measures (such as maintenance of blood pressure levels and respiratory functionality) as indicated by clinical signs, symptoms, and measurements. In severe cases, observations should continue for at least several days until clinical condition is stable and normal. Since abamectin is believed to enhance GABA activity in animals, it is probably wise to avoid drugs that enhance GABA activity (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, valproic acid) in patients with potentially toxic abamectin exposure.",
