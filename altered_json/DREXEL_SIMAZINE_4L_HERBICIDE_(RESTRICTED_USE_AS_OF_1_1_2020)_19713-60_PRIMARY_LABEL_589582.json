NOTE: The use of gastric lavage without administration of an adsorbent bent has not shown any clinical benefit. Do not use supplemental oxygen. Eye splashes from concentrated material should be treated by an eye specialist after initial treatment. With the possibility of late onset corneal ulceration, it is advised that patients with Paraquat eye injuries are reviewed by an eye specialist the day after first presentation. Use treatment that is appropriate for chemical burns. Intact skin is an effective barrier to Paraquat; however, contact with irritated or cut skin or repeated contact with intact skin may result in poisoning.",
