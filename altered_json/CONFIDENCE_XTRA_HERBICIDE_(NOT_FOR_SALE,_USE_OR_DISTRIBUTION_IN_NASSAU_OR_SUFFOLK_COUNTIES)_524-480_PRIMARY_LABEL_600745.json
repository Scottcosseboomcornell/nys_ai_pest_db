Engineering Controls: When handlers use enclosed cabs in a manner that meets the requirements listed in the Worker Protection Standard (WPS) for agricultural pesticides 40 CFR 170.240(d)(5), the handler PPE requirements may be reduced or modified as specified in the WPS. Follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions for cleaning/maintaining PPE. If no such instructions for washables exist, use detergent and hot water. Keep and wash PPE separately from other laundry. Discard clothing or other absorbent materials that have been drenched or heavily contaminated with the product\u2019s concentrate. Do not reuse them. IMPORTANT: When reduced PPE is worn because an enclosed system is being used, handlers must be provided all PPE specified above for \u201capplicators and other handlers\u201d and have such PPE immediately available for use in an emergency, such as a spill or equipment breakdown.",
