            "general_Info": "Corrosive. Causes irreversible eye damage. Do not get in eyes or on clothing. Wear protective eyewear, goggles, or face shields. Harmful if swallowed or absorbed through the skin. Avoid contact with skin. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling, and before eating, drinking, chewing gum or using tobacco. Remove contaminated clothing and wash before reuse. Prolonged or frequently repeated exposure may cause allergic skin reactions in some individuals. This pesticide is toxic to fish, birds, mammals, and aquatic invertebrates. Drift and runoff may be hazardous to aquatic organisms in neighboring areas. This product is highly toxic to bees exposed to direct treatment or residues on blooming crops or weeds. Do not use or store near heat or open flame.",
            "if_In_Eyes": "If in eyes: Hold eye open and rinse slowly and gently with water for 15-20 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after the first 5 minutes, then continue rinsing eye. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Swallowed": "If swallowed: Call poison control center or doctor immediately for treatment advice. Do not give any liquid to the person. Do not induce vomiting unless told to do so by the poison control center or doctor. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.",
            "if_On_Skin": "If on skin or clothing: Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 minutes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Inhaled": "If inhaled: Move person to fresh air. If person is not breathing, call 911 or an ambulance, then give artificial respiration, preferably by mouth-to-mouth, if possible. Call a poison control center or doctor for further treatment advice.",
            "physician_Note": "NOTE TO PHYSICIAN: Contains petroleum distillate \u2013 vomiting may cause aspiration pneumonia. Probably mucosal damage may contraindicate the use of gastric lavage. Early signs of intoxication include dilation of pupils, muscular incoordination, and muscular tremors. If toxicity from exposure has progressed to cause severe vomiting, the extent of resultant fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be gauged. Appropriate supportive parenteral fluid replacement therapy should be given, along with other required supportive measures (such as maintenance of blood pressure levels and proper respiratory functionality) as indicated by clinical signs, symptoms, and measurements. In severe cases, observations should continue for at least several days until clinical condition is stable and normal. Since emamectin benzoate is believed to enhance GABA activity in animals, it is probably wise to avoid drugs that enhance GABA activity (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, valproic acid) in patients with potentially toxic emamectin benzoate exposure. Have the product container or label with you when calling a poison control center or doctor, or going for treatment. HOT LINE NUMBER: For 24-Hour Medical Emergency Assistance (Human or Animal) Or Chemical Emergency Assistance (Spill, Leak, Fire or Accident) Call 1-800-888-8372."
