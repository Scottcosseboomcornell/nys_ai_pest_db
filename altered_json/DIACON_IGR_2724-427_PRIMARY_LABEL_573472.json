            "general_Info": "(S)-Methoprene, the active ingredient in DIACON\u00ae IGR, protects stored grains, agricultural commodities, seed, and animal feeds from damaging insects by interfering with the normal process of insect development. Unlike traditional pesticides, DIACON\u00ae IGR is not an adulticide, but its residual activity prevents the development of larvae into adults. When used according to the label directions, DIACON\u00ae IGR inhibits growth of larvae of these insects: almond moth, Indian meal moth, lesser grain borer, sawtoothed grain beetle, merchant grain beetle, red flour beetle, confused flour beetle, and other insect pests that are affected by Insect Growth Regulators (IGR\u2019s). Treat existing insect populations with an adulticide, then apply DIACON\u00ae IGR for residual protection.",
