Measurement of blood cholinesterase activity may be useful in monitoring exposure but decisions regarding treatment will usually need to be made before test results are available. If signs of cholinesterase inhibition appear, atropine sulfate is antidotal. 2-PAM (PROTOPAM) is also antidotal and may be used in conjunction with atropine but should not be used alone.",
