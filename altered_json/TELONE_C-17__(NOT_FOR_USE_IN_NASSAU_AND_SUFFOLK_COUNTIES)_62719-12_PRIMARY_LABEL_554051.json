This product contains 1,3-dichloropropene, which has been determined to cause tumors in laboratory animals. Risks can be reduced by exactly following directions for use, precautionary statements, and by wearing the personal protective equipment specified in this labeling. \u2022 Fatal if inhaled or swallowed. Poisonous liquid and vapor. Corrosive. Liquid causes skin burns and irreversible eye damage. Do not breathe vapor or gas. Do not get in eyes, on skin or on clothing. Chloropicrin is readily identifiable by smell. Exposures to very low concentrations of vapor will cause irritation of eyes, nose and throat. Continued exposure after irritation occurs, or exposure to higher concentration may cause painful irritation or temporary blindness.",
            "if_In_Eyes": "Hold eye open and rinse slowly and gently with water for 15-20 minutes. Remove contact lenses, if present, after 5 minutes, then continue rinsing eye. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Swallowed": "Call a poison control center or doctor immediately for treatment advice. Have person sip a glass of water if able to swallow. Do not induce vomiting unless told to do so by the poison control center or doctor. Do not give anything by mouth to an unconscious person.",
            "if_On_Skin": "Take off contaminated clothing. Rinse skin immediately with plenty of water for 15-20 minutes. Call a poison control center or doctor for treatment advice.",
            "if_Inhaled": "Move person to fresh air. If person is not breathing, call 911 or an ambulance, and then give artificial respiration, preferably mouth-to-mouth, if possible. Call a poison control center or doctor for further treatment advice.",
            "physician_Note": "Because rapid absorption may occur through lungs if product is aspirated and cause systemic effects, the decision to induce vomiting or not should be made by a physician. If lavage is performed, endotracheal and/or esophageal control is suggested. Danger from lung aspiration must be weighed against toxicity when considering emptying the stomach. Chloropicrin is a volatile liquid that is the active ingredient in tear gas. As a gas it is a powerful lachrymator. Early symptoms of overexposure are lachrymation, respiratory distress and vomiting. Pulmonary edema may develop later. Treatment is symptomatic.",
