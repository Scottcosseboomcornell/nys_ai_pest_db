            "physician_Note": "Note to Physician: Recommendations for Medical Treatment for Abamectin 0.15 Select (Avermectin B1) Acute Toxicity: Early signs of intoxication include mydriasis (dilated pupils), ataxia (unsteadiness) and muscle tremors. Toxicity following accidental ingestion of the concentrate can be minimized by inducing vomiting within one-half hour of exposure. If toxicity from exposure has progressed to cause severe vomiting, the extent of resultant fluid and electrolyte imbalance should be gauged. Appropriate supportive parenteral fluid replacement therapy should be given, along with other required supportive measures (such as maintenance of blood pressure levels) as indicated by clinical signs, symptoms and measurements. In severe cases, observations should continue for at least several days until clinical condition is stable and normal. Since avermectin is believed to enhance GABA activity in animals, it is probably wise to avoid drugs that enhance GABA activity (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, valproic acid) in patients with potentially toxic avermectin exposure. (Avermectin B1): Have the product container or label with you when calling a poison control center or doctor or going for treatment. For Medical Emergency call 911.",
